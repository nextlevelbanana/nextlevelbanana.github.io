	<p>So yeah, it's my birthday. And I want to spend it surrounded by two kinds of things: <h3>(a) cool people and (b) weird games</h3></p>
	<p>If I sent you this invitation, it means you're (a) (sorry I called you a thing, I just couldn't find a better word). So please come, <b>and bring a (b)</b>! (You can also bring other (a)s, just let me know so I can plan food.)</p>

	<h4>FAQ</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><b>What constitutes a "weird game"?</b> I'll have on tap such classics as Katamari Damacy, Baba is You, Spaceteam the card game, and the amazing and amazingly obscure Pony Island. But weird is subjective, so bring whatever!</li>
		<li><b>Can it be a game I made myself?</b> Yes. Please. Obviously. Yes. That would be amazing.</li>
		<li><b>What systems does this party support?</b> I've got Windows, Linux, Switch, and PS4(+VR). Feel free to bring whatever extra tech you might need (an extra monitor might not be a bad idea...). Games that don't require computers are of course also welcome.</li>
		<li><b>Can I bring a game that uses real fire?</b> ... no.</li>
		<li><b>But I don't have any weird games!</b> That's fine, just bring yourself!</li>
		<li><b>Do I have to play?</b> No, it's totally cool if you just come to hang and/or watch other people play. I'm going for more "arcade" and less "game night" here.</li>
		<li><b>What's the food/drink situation?</b> There will be both! Drinks will be both alcoholic and not. Let me know your dietary preferences when you RSVP.</li>
		<li><b>I want to hang but parties stress me out!</b> HMU, we'll figure something out.</li>
